I am a software developer from Davao City, Philippines. I mostly do `web development`, but can also do mobile apps with
`flutter` and `dart`; desktop apps with `electronjs` and `wpf`. I often learn new technologies to use on my projects during my free time. This ensures I am updated with the latest trends when it comes to software development.
