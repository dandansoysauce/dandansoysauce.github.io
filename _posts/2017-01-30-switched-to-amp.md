Before I switched to AMP - First, I lost my GitHub account because I installed MIUI on my phone and forgot to backup
my Google Authenticator, for my two-factor auth. Second, as you may have noticed, I also switched to GitLab Pages and to my surprise,
GitLab has unlimited private repositories for free, and boom, sold. Third, I fixed some stupid yet serious 
grammatical errors and damn, that was really stupid of me. And lastly, there, I finally switched to [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/).

AMP or Accelerated Mobile Pages is, as their site says:
> a way to build web pages for static content that render fast.

And it's superb. Plus your site gets to have a proper seat on Google's first page, given that you have quite a number of readers.
Since I only post text, images and mostly basic stuff, my home page loads for about a second and my other pages, a little bit less than that.

To finish off my AMP switch, I also added an AMP compatible Disqus comments. I had a small wrinkle implementing one: it required
the universal code to be hosted on a different domain, and I don't have one! I leech on free stuff.
Luckily, a guy named [James Tomasino](https://github.com/jamestomasino) hosted one and made it publicly available. Seriously, what a guy.
If you're like me, then this one's for you: [Peekaboo](https://labs.tomasino.org/disqus-in-amp/). Additionaly, I want to thank [Pure.css](http://purecss.io/)
for my buttons, simple but sweet.

I'll write a How-To on implementing AMP to your Jekyll website. Using, of course, James' universal code. So tune in.
